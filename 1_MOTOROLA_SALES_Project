 🔍 This dashboard provides real-time insights into sales performance, allowing users to explore key metrics like:
📌 Product performance
 📌 Region-wise sales distribution
 📌 Delivery status tracking
 📌 Payment method breakdown
 📌 Order trends and volume over time
💡 Tools Used:
Power BI (DAX, Visualizations, Data Modeling)
Excel & CSV data sources
Interactive filters and slicers
KPI cards, bar charts, and map visuals
🎯 Objective:
 To give Motorola’s sales and business team a clear, visual overview of their order performance and revenue drivers — enabling faster decisions and data-driven strategies.
